# Pilot Plan & Metrics

## Pilot Targets
- 3–5 NGOs/training centers with active volunteer/apprenticeship programs.
- 2–3 SME employers willing to consume verification reports.

## Pilot Scope
- Candidate onboarding and claim creation.
- Verifier inbox + email-based verification.
- Shareable verification reports with credibility breakdown.
- Admin dispute handling.

## Success Metrics
- Organizations onboarded.
- Verification completion rate; median time to verify.
- Employer views per verified report.
- Fraud/rejection rate trend.
- Outcomes enabled (internships/jobs/scholarships).

## Runbook
1. Select pilot orgs; create verifier accounts and org profiles.
2. Import or have candidates submit first claims with evidence.
3. Send verification requests; monitor completion.
4. Share reports with partner employers; collect feedback on clarity and trust.
5. Track disputes and moderation outcomes.
6. Iterate on scoring weights and UI clarity based on pilot feedback.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Low verifier response**: reminders; dashboard visibility; SMS backup later.
- **Data sensitivity**: clear visibility controls; minimal data collection; opt-outs.
- **Fraud attempts**: rate limits, org verification, audit review.
